## 👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub
I'm just starting my journey in the tech world and taking my first steps here on GitHub. I'm passionate about learning, creating, and collaborating. I’m also looking to connect with other developers, learn from the community, and grow together. If you have any tips or resources for beginners, please, feel free to share!

🚀 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently diving into the Full Stack Developer course by Rocketseat, where I’m learning key skills to build real-world applications from scratch.

🎓 I'm pursuing a Bachelor’s degree at UFABC, and I’m also exploring the possibility of remotely joining another university program to expand my knowledge in the tech field.

🌱 I’m especially interested in web development, open source projects, and building meaningful tools that can help people.

⚡ Fun facts: I play several musical instruments 🎸🥁, and I’m a big fan of games across different platforms 🎮.
